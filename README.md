Traveling Salesman Problem
==========================

An exhaustive and heuristic solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem.
The input problem must have the same distance between city A and B in both directions.
The graph of the cities must be euclidean.

Usage
-----
application &lt;number of cities&gt; &lt;adjacency matrix file&gt;

Exhaustive Algorithm
--------------------
The exhaustive algorithm uses the Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm to generate
permutations. We are only interested in one cheapest tour. Therefore we applied
two optimizations. First of all we observe that for N cities there are N tours
that only differ by starting city. By picking a static start city we only need
to check (n-1)! permutations. Furthermore we observe that for any given tour there
is a tour that only differs by direction. The second half of the permutations
generated by the Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter are the tours of the first half with the
opposite direction. These permutations are not considered and generated.
We only need to check (n-1)!/2 permutations. For a problem set consisting of
5 cities we only need to check 12 permutations instead of all 120 permutations.

Heuristic Algorithm
-------------------
The heuristic algorithm makes use of triangle inequality.
